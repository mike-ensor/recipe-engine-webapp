This is a simple application designed to be used for cloud based testing, more specifically
coudfoundry.org, appfog.com and other open source controlled PaaS public clouds

My intention is to provide a way to have a person (via any OAuth) share how they feel, 
then possibly post on FB, G+, twitter or other social media platform?  This data can be 
compiled to make projections on how people feel using MapReduce or something else 
that can show off some load

This won't be a very fancy app, very simple, mostly to test the cloud companies
